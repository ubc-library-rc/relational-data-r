## 1. What is relational database?

To put it simple, relational data are multiple tables of data.
Relational data are data organized into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row, typically seen in relational databases.


## 2. Why to use relational database?

[For data analysts](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/04/relational-data-models-in-r-2/): "Relational databases are a very powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating data. However, many modeling workflows require a great deal of time and effort for wrangling data from databases into a flat data frame or table format. Only then the actual data analysis can start."

**For organizations and companies**: benefits of relational databases
- Efficient storage
- Encryption (not covered)
- Authentication (not covered)

## 3. How to work with data from relational database?

Available platforms: MySQL, DataGrip, SAS Proc SQL etc.
Today, we will work in R Studio to demonstrate how to work with related data frames through `dplyr` package, which imitates SQL.
