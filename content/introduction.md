## What is relational data?

Relational data are data organized into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row, typically seen in relational databases.

## Why to use relational data?

[For data analysts](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/04/relational-data-models-in-r-2/): "Relational databases are a very powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating data. However, many modeling workflows require a great deal of time and effort for wrangling data from databases into a flat data frame or table format. Only then the actual data analysis can start."

**For organizations and companies**: benefits of relational databases
- Efficient storage
- Encryption (not covered)

## How to work with relational data?

Available platforms: MySQL,DataGrip, SAS Proc SQL etc.
Today, we will work in R Studio to demonstrate how to work with relational data through `dplyr` package, which imitates SQL.
