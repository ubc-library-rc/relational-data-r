# **Recap**

This workshop covered the need to work with multiple data frames, how to identify primary and foreign keys, and how to use basic mutating and filtering joins. Now you are equipped to start working with multiple data frames through R.  

Many topics are not covered; for example, what if there is no primary key in a table? As you work on joins more, you may encounter problems related to things not covered here. The following resources might be helpful.
