> This package contains information about all flights that departed from
> NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) to destinations in the United States,
> Puerto Rico, and the American Virgin Islands) in 2013: 336,776 flights
> in total. To help understand what causes delays, it also includes a
> number of other useful datasets. ![relational

`flight`: All flights that departed from New York City (NYC) in 2013

```{r}
View(flights)    
?flights
```

`weather`: Hourly meterological data for each airport in NYC:

-   John F.Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
-   LaGuardia Airport (LGA)
-   Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)

```{r}
View(weather)    
?weather
```

`planes`: Construction information about each plane

```{r}
View(planes)    
?planes
```

`airports`: Airport names and locations

```{r}
View(airports)    
?airports
```

`airline`: Translation between two letter carrier codes and names

```{r}
View(airlines)    
?airlines
```

## 1.1 Exercise 1

Why don't we put all the information in a table? What's the benefits of
creating multiple tables and linking them by relations?

# 2 [Keys](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#keys)

> The variables used to connect each pair of tables are called **keys**.
> A key is a variable (or a set of variables) that uniquely identifies
> an observation. There are two types of keys:

> A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table.
> For example, `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely
> identifies each plane in the `planes` table.

> A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table.
> For example, the `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it appears
> in the `flights` table where it matches each flight to a unique plane
> in the `planes` table.

> A variable can be both a primary key and a foreign key. For example,
> `origin` is part of the `weather` primary key, and is also a foreign
> key for the `airport` table.

> Once you've identified the primary keys in your tables, it's good
> practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each
> observation. One way to do that is to `count()` the primary keys and
> look for entries where n is greater than one:

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## 2.1 Exercise 2

What's the primary key in the `airports` table?

```{r}
airports %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

# 3 Join tables

Mutating joins vs filtering joins:

> **mutating joins** add new ***variables*** to one data frame from
> matching observations in another

> **filtering joins** filter ***observations*** from one data frame
> based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table

## 3.1 Mutating joins

Mutating join example: add full airline name from `airlines` table to
the `flights` data

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, tailnum, carrier) %>%  
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
```

It is called "mutating" joins because it could be achieved by using
`mutate()` and R's base subsetting:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, tailnum, carrier) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)]) 
# hard to generalise when you need to match multiple variables, and takes close reading to figure out the overall intent.
```

### 3.1.1 Inner join

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3")
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3")
x
y
```

```{r}
x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")
```

### 3.1.2 Outer join

Left join vs right join vs full join

> `left_join` keeps all observations in left table

> `right_join` keeps all observations in right table

> `full_join` keeps all observations in both tables ![left vs right vs
> full
> join](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c12ca9e12ed26a7c5d2aa08e36d2ac4fb593f1e/79980/diagrams/join-outer.png)

> Limitation: a Venn diagram can't show what happens when keys don't
> uniquely identify an observation

### 3.1.3 Duplicate keys

> 1.  One table has duplicate keys. This is useful when you want to add
>     in additional information as there is typically a one-to-many
>     relationship. ![one to
>     many](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6faac3e996263827cb57fc5803df6192541a9a4b/c7d74/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     1, "x4")
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2")
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

> 2.  Both tables have duplicate keys. This is usually an error because
>     in neither table do the keys uniquely identify an observation.
>     When you join duplicated keys, you get all possible combinations,
>     the Cartesian product: ![many to
>     many](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d37530bbf7749f48c02684013ae72b2996b07e25/37510/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png)

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     3, "x4")
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     2, "y3",
     3, "y4")
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

### 3.1.4 Key columns

> So far, the pairs of tables have always been joined by a single
> variable, and that variable has the same name in both tables. That
> constraint was encoded by `by = "key"`.

> 1.  The default, `by = NULL`, uses all variables that appear in both
>     tables, the so called *natural* join. For example, the `flights`
>     and `weather` tables match on their common variables: `year`,
>     `month`, `day`, `hour` and `origin`.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, tailnum, carrier) %>%  
  left_join(weather)
```

2.  When a "common" variable in two tables with different meanings. Uses
    only some of the common variables by specifying `by = "x"`.

> For example, `flights` and `planes` have `year` variables, but

-   `year` in `flights` means year of departure.
-   `year` in `planes` means year of manufacture.

> they mean different things so we only join by `tailnum`.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, tailnum, carrier) %>%  
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```

3.  When variables with the same meaning are named differently in two
    tables, use them by specifying `by = c("a" = "b")`.

> For example, if we want to draw a map we need to combine the `flights`
> data with the `airports` data which contains the location (`lat` and
> `lon`) of each airport. Each flight has an `origin` and `destination`
> airport, so we need to specify which one we want to join to:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, dest, tailnum, carrier) %>%  
  left_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa"))

flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, tailnum, carrier) %>%  
  left_join(airports, c("origin" = "faa"))
```

### 3.1.5 [Exercise](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#exercises-30) 3

> Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

## 3.2 Filtering joins

> Similar to mutating joins, but affect the **observations** rather than
> the **variables**:

> `semi_join(x, y)` *keeps* all observations in x that have a match in
> y.

> `anti_join(x, y)` *drops* all observations in x that have a match in
> y.

### 3.2.1 Semi-join

> Semi-joins are useful for matching filtered summary tables back to the
> original rows. For example, imagine you've found the top two most
> popular destinations:

```{r}
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(2)
top_dest
```

> Now you want to find each flight that went to one of those
> destinations. You could construct a filter yourself:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)
```

You can also use a semi-join, which does the same thing and could be
more handy when you have multiple variables.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  semi_join(top_dest)
```

> Graphically, a semi-join looks like this:
> ![semi-join](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/028065a7f353a932d70d2dfc82bc5c5966f768ad/85a30/diagrams/join-semi.png)

> Only the existence of a match is important; it doesn't matter which
> observation is matched. This means that filtering joins never
> duplicate rows like mutating joins do:
> ![semi-join-many](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1d0283160251afaeca35cba216736eb995fee00/1b3cd/diagrams/join-semi-many.png)

### 3.2.2 Anti-join

> The inverse of a semi-join is an anti-join. An anti-join keeps the
> rows that don't have a match:
> ![anti-join](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f29a85efd53a079cc84c14ba4ba6894e238c3759/c1408/diagrams/join-anti.png)

> Anti-joins are useful for diagnosing join mismatches. For example,
> when connecting `flights` and `planes`, you might be interested to
> know that there are many flights that don't have a match in `planes`:

```{r}
flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
```

### 3.2.3 [Exercises](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#exercises-31) 4

> 2.  Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at
>     least 100 flights.
